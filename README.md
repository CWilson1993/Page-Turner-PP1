# Page Turner

This was a project to create a place for everyone to read books and discuss them freely. The website gives people an understanding of what the site is about and what books they could read. 

- __Published site available here: [Page Turner](https://cwilson1993.github.io/Page-Turner-PP1/)__

## Testing

For the testing I apply a number of different methods.

- __Responsiveness testing__
  - I used dev tools in Goggle Chrome to see what my site looked like at different screen sizes. 


- __Google Lighthouse__
  - I used another useful add on, Google Lighthouse, which measured the performance of the site on mobile and desktop screens.

- __Casual Testing__
  - I sent the site to some family and friends for testing. They tested it on the screens they use normally, some having mainly apple products and others had android devices. I also tested this myself on my on mobile. All the devices used displayed the content correctly and as I expected it to. 


- __Online Validators__
  - All the HTML code was run through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and all the CSS code was run through [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). 
  - There were zero errors returned from both validators.
  - All the backup screenshots can be found below:

## Deployment

- The site was deployed using GitHub pages. The steps are quite straightforward once you have a GitHub account and repository already set up:
  - In the GitHub repository screen click the "Settings" section.
  - Under "Code and automation" click the "Pages" part.
  - On the next screen make sure the "Branch" is set to main and the folder is set to root, once done press the save button.
  - Above the source section it will initially say "Your site is ready to be published", after a few minutes this should change to "Your site is published" it will also include the URL for your site.
